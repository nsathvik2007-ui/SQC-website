## Sathvik's Portfolio Landing Page

Hi, I'm **Sathvik** 

First-year student of **Instrumentation and Control Engineering** at NIT Jalandhar.

This is my landing page — built from Tailwind, dark cosmic aesthetics, and just to have something cool to show when people ask "do you have a website?"

## Tech I used here

- HTML + Tailwind CSS (CDN — no build step)
- Custom CSS for gradients, glows, glassmorphism & starry background
- Pure vanilla — no React / Next.js / frameworks
  
## What I'm currently into 

- Learning web development 
- Getting better at DSA & competitive programming
- Figuring out how control systems actually work in real life
- Trying to stay awake in my classes
